# FizzBuzz Application 

## This is a unique stand-alone application designed to take two inputs from the user and display a custom solution 

This site is compiled of two HTML pages that are unique and serve their own purpose.
The user inputs will act as multiples that will be compared against a number range from 1 to 100 using a modulus operator. The solution will display in a table, counting in sequence from the start to the end of the range. 
The "FizzBuzz" button will call the function to collect the inputs and determine their legitimacy as a multiple. If a multiple of *input 1* is found, **"Fizz"** will display. If a multiple of *input 2* is found, **"Buzz"** will display.
If a multiple of both inputs is found, considered a special case, **"FizzBuzz"** will display.
